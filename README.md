# Household Energy Consumption and Forecasting Dashboard (Tableau) 💡

## 1. Overview
Developed a detailed Tableau dashboard focused on analyzing granular, time-series household energy consumption data (e.g., hourly/daily meter readings). The project provides clear visualizations of consumption patterns, helping to identify energy wastage and peak demand periods.

### 🎯 Goal
To accurately measure and visualize energy usage over time, identify seasonal and daily peak consumption, and provide actionable insights for users aiming to reduce utility costs and optimize appliance usage.

## 2. Tools & Technologies
- **Business Intelligence:** **Tableau Desktop** (for visual analysis)
- **Data Preparation:** Tableau Prep / SQL (Used for aggregating high-frequency time-series data)
- **Advanced Features:** Time-Series Charts, **Forecasting Feature**, Reference Lines, LOD Expressions (for consumption benchmarking).
- **Domain Focus:** Utilities, IoT/Sensor Data Analysis.

## 3. Key Actions / Process (Time Series Analysis & Metrics)
- **Data Granularity Handling:** Aggregated high-frequency meter readings (e.g., every 15 minutes) into daily and monthly views within the data preparation layer for efficient visualization.
- **Trend Identification:** Created detailed **Time-Series Line Charts**  to visualize daily and weekly consumption trends, highlighting peak seasonal usage (e.g., summer A/C usage).
- **Peak/Off-Peak Analysis:** Used calculated fields and conditional formatting to clearly separate **Peak Load Hours** from Off-Peak hours, crucial for cost-saving strategies.
- **Forecasting:** Applied Tableau’s built-in forecasting models to predict future energy consumption based on historical patterns, supporting budget planning.
- **Benchmarking:** Implemented **LOD Expressions** (Level of Detail) to compare individual household usage against regional or project averages.

## 4. Key Achievements & Results
- **Cost Reduction Insight:** Clearly identified periods of unnecessary high consumption, providing the user with specific times/seasons where cost-saving measures would have the greatest impact.
- **Predictive Capability:** Demonstrated the use of forecasting tools to provide a projection of future utility demand, a valuable skill in load management.
- **Tableau Mastery:** Showcased proficiency in handling, aggregating, and visualizing dense, continuous **time-series data**—a fundamental skill for BI analysts.
